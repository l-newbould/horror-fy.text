# Gothic Horror Text Transformer

## Description

This project uses GPT models to turn regular text into gothic horror style. As a fan of gothic horror, I wanted to create something that adds a dark, eerie tone to any text, with rich descriptions and a sense of mystery.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gothic-horror-text-transformer.git
cd gothic-horror-text-transformer
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install openai
pip install confif
```

3. Replace "api_key" with your OpenAI API key in your config file.


### Example

Input:
"The sun was shining brightly, casting a warm golden glow over the bustling park."

Output:
"The sun, once bright and full of life, now seemed like a cruel reminder of the shadows closing in. The park, once full of laughter, now whispered with the chill of an unseen presence."
